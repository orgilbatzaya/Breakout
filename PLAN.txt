I think "No Escape!" variant is interesting because the bricks fall after being hit.
These falling bricks then become the main weapon to defeat the enemies.

I intend to build three levels. The first will have two rows of blocks, in which each block
is destroyed by one hit. The second will have one more row of blocks, but about
a third of the blocks will be stronger and require more hits. The last will have the
same number of rows as in level 2, but two-thirds of the blocks here will be strong blocks.
Furthermore, as the levels progress, the balls speed will increase incrementally.

I intend to have three types of blocks. The first will be a basic weak block which
is destroyed after one hit. The second will be a strong block, which will take two hits.
The third will be a power up block, which is destroyed after one hit, and the user
must "catch" the power up as it falls to gain the power. These three types will be
differentiated by a different color or design.

I intend to have three power-ups. One will give the user an extra life, the other will lengthen
the paddle, and the last will enable the user to user to press a key to escape the level.

The cheat keys will be :
 - (0, 1, 2, 3) to navigate to the the start screen and any level.
 - "I" to gain an infinite or very large number of lives
 - "R" to reset ball and paddle position in the middle

 The extra part I intend to add is to have certain blocks fall off  when hit instead
 of disappearing and get added to a cache. Then with a certain key, the user can shoot
 the blocks as projectiles to hit remaining blocks. This is a substantial edition because
 it adds another dimension to destroying blocks, gives the user another thing to catch, and is
 inspired by the "No Escape!" variant.
