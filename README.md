### Running the Program

Main class: BreakoutGame.java

Data files needed: 
ball.gif, brick1.gif, brick2.gif, brick10.gif,
paddle.gif - all from lab_bounce

Key/Mouse inputs:
left/right arrow keys to move paddle. "L" to skip level if given
powerup. "S" to start game. Spacebar to start play on each level.


Cheat keys:
(0, 1, 2, 3) to navigate to any level and splash screen.
"R" to reset ball in middle and stop motion.
"I" to add 1000 lives.

Known Bugs: My projectiles don't function correctly yet
since they do not actually "hit" the regular blocks correctly.
The bouncer also tends to pass through weak (blue) blocks instead of bouncing 
off of them. Sometimes the add-lives power up adds more lives than just
one each catch. 

Extra credit: The orange blocks fall down when hit instead
of disappearing and when caught, fire back up. These are
my "projectiles".
